This repository contains the code for our ME592 Final Project that aimed at predicting the Remaining Useful Life of engine using the NASA turbofan engine dataset (C-MAPSS)
 
This dataset can be accessed using the following link

We have implemented different Machine learning and deep learning models for the same objective which are available in the google colab notebooks. 
 
These are:
LSTM
Bi-LSTM
CNN
CNN + LSTM
Temporal Fusion Transformer

The google colab notebooks can be accessed here
